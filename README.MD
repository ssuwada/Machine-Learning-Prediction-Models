## Machine Learning Predictive Models Practice

During the Predictive Analytics course, I undertook a comprehensive project and collaborated with Catalina Maria Aya to reproduce the article titled 'Time-series forecasting of seasonal items sales using machine learning â€“ A comparative analysis.'

Together, we achieved similar results and proposed an alternative forecasting method for Furniture Sales. My responsibilities included the implementation of models such as ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and CNN, utilizing grid search to identify optimal parameters.

I successfully combined all predicted outputs, resulting in a decreased error, specifically in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

Throughout the course, I also developed my own code for various predictive models, which can be found in separate folders. These models include:

1. Naive Forecasts
2. Probabilistic Forecasting
3. Regression Models
4. Double Exponential Forecasting.
